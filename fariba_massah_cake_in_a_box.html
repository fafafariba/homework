    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What is cake in a box you say? Cake in a box is cake that comes prepackaged in a box at a fraction of the cost of fancy store or restaurant cake plus ten times more yummy.*</p>
    <p><i>*This statement has been scientifically verified. Don't believe me? Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake">wikipedia</a>
    </i></p>
    <a name="ingredients" />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cake Mix from Box of Choice</li>
      <li>1 c Milk (or More)</li>
      <li>3 Any Sized Eggs (because I hate it when they specify egg size, like it really makes that much of a difference)</li>
      <li>3/4 c Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="directions" />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix everything together in a mixing bowl that's lying around somewhere (preferably one that's clean)</li>
      <li>Mix some more</li>
      <li>And then some more</li>
      <li>Oil the baking pan of your choice (again not gonna tell you what size becaus I hate it when they tell you the dimensions of the pan)</li>
      <li>Oh yeah, preheat the oven. Shit. Now you have to wait for the oven to get hot.</li>
      <li>Ok, oven's hot, put it in the oven for like 25 minutes</li>
      <li>MOST IMPORTANT PART: Lick the mixing bowl clean</li>
      <li>After 25 minutes, make sure cake is not burnt. Stick a fork in the cake. If there's any residue on the fork prongs, needs more baking. If not, then it's ready for your consumption and pleasure.</li>
    </ol>
